# RoboND-Project3
Implementation of Project 3 of [udacity robot software nanodegree](https://blog.udacity.com/2019/01/learn-robotics-engineering-program.html)

## Installation

Download the packages into your ROS workspace. Please unzip the "classroom_map.pgm.zip" in the [locate_my_robot/maps folder](https://github.com/CenturyLiu/RoboND-Project3/tree/master/locate_my_robot/maps). (The map is too big to be uploaded directly onto github)
